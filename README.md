The **Gas Utility Service Management System** is a web-based application developed using Django to streamline customer service requests for a gas utility provider. It allows users to register, log in, and submit service requests for gas connections, maintenance, or complaints while tracking their request status in real-time. The system features an admin dashboard where company representatives can monitor, update, and resolve service requests efficiently. Users receive email notifications about status changes, ensuring seamless communication. Built with Django for the backend, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, and SQLite/PostgreSQL for the database, the system ensures a secure, responsive, and user-friendly experience. Additionally, role-based access control differentiates user and admin functionalities, making it an efficient and scalable solution for managing gas utility services.
